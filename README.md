## Overview of the statistical analysis
 * The purpose of the analysis was to provide a bike trip analysis of the NYC Citi Bike, Using Pandas to change the
 "tripduration" column of the data from an integer to a datetime datatype.And then,using the converted datatype to 
  create a set of visualizations:
    * Visualizations showing the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
    * Visualizations showing the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
    * That showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
    * Two of  the Visualizations created in this module for  final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
